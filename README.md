# 🧠 Learning Purpose

This project helped me understand:

- How to toggle between two UI sections using JavaScript (adding/removing a class)
- How CSS z-index, transition, and pseudo-elements (::before) can be used to build animations
- Structuring small front-end projects and pushing them to GitHub
